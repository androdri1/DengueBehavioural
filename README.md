# Code and dataset for replicability of JDS: Behavioural Response to a Sudden Health Risk: Dengue and Educational Outcomes in Colombia
This repository includes the files required to replicate the main findings of this article and its supplementary material (apart from the student level tables, which is the main SABER11 dataset that is available by ICFES). If you need something more detailed on the construction of the data, please contact us.

Start running DEN_03* to produce the main dataset, and keep the numeric order. The file "0.Programs" is called directly by the other do-files. All these routines where designed for Stata 13 and 14, and some of them require user packages such as "texdoc" and "sjlatex"
